Stash is a persistence engine for .NET. It eschews relational models and object/relational mapping
and instead follows the No-Sql paradigm, with inspiration taken from CouchDB.

Stash currently uses ESENT as its persistence engine. This makes Stash dependent on a Microsoft operating 
system. Other persistent engines may be implemented.
